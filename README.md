##What does the code do ?
Python Implementation of Prim's Algorithm from Cormen's book.

##TO-DO ->
* Not storing the parent of every visited node, which will be then used to get the path of the minimum weighted tree.

* Performance can be improved by keeping the info of all nodes( like a "cache" ) in the class "Graph"

* "Minimum Priority Queue" is not "theroetically" implemented. Implement it. If possible, Fibonacci heap instead of binary heap.
